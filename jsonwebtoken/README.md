# `jsonwebtoken`

```toml
jsonwebtoken = { version = "9.3.1", default-features = false }
serde = { version = "1.0.219", features = ["derive"] }
```

JWT has 3 parts:

1. Header
    - Metadata about the token( `alg`, `typ`, etc.)
2. Payload
    - This is the body of the JWT.
    - Consists of claims (registered claims like `exp`, `sub`, `iat`, and custom claims)
3. Signature
    - Used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that the message wasn't changed along
      the way.
    - Cryptographic proof the payload wasn't tampered with.

So, technically:
- Payload = the whole JSON body
- Claims = the individual keyâ€“value pairs inside the payload
